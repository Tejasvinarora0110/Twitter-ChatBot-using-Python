__*Tweepy*__

__Introduction__

If you are new to Tweepy, this is the place to begin. The goal of this tutorial is to get you set-up and rolling with Tweepy. We wonâ€™t go into too much detail here, just some important basics.

__API__

The API class provides access to the entire twitter RESTful API methods. Each method can accept various parameters and return responses. For more information about these methods please refer to API Reference.

__Models__

When we invoke an API method most of the time returned back to us will be a Tweepy model class instance. This will contain the data returned from Twitter which we can then use inside our application.
